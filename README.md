A website showcasing debates and data about the impact of plastics to marine life and our oceans 

Rafa:
should summarise the project, define everyone’s role, reference key sources of inspirations, introduce your dataset (source, authors, publication date, and context), 

Website Design: 
In terms of the visual style of the website, we wanted it to be minimal, simple and easy to read. The blue palette was used to represent the ocean against a white background. The content was divided across five web pages to make it more manageable and easier to absorb in smaller, organised sections.
For extra creativity, fun and engagement, three of the web pages play a themed sound effect when clicked on. We believed that this would help enhance user experience and immersion.

Technical: 
The website is easy for users to navigate around, the fixed navigation bar at the top allows for simple userinterface. We alos have included an adaptive image gallery that fits any screen size and layout integration is kept and blocks for any overlapping or breaking of the page.

Challenges: 
There was a large volume of research from many sources.  This required careful selection of credible data and identification of key themes.  It was very challenging to summarise the research into clear, accessible content for a general audience. #
