Project summary: Our project is a website which showcases the everlasting effects of plastic in the oceans and the effects it has on marine life. Our aim was to deliver a journalistic story which informs visitors of the environmental crisis while also showcasing the diverse and sometimes conflicting perspectives surrounding the topic by involving two different views. Ultimately, the problem at hand is at an incline which is why we concluded with solutions on the matter. 

Roles: As we were assigned as one of the smaller groups, distributing a fair workload to each group member was very straight forward. Rafael’s role was to set up the layout of the 5 pages while Kiran’s role was to set up the navigation menu and title banner. Kiran then had responsibility for the “Home Page” page, “The Key Facts” page, and the “More Information” page. Rafael had the responsibility of adding themed sound effects when clicking the first three pages and completing the “The Oceans” page and the “What Can We Do?” page.

Key sources of inspiration: David Attenborough's strong standpoint on the use of plastic which was aired on BBC. We used this source of information on our home page as it is part of our dataset. Another inspiration is National Geographic and the many documentaries they film surrounding the problem. And lastly, Donald Trump's standpoint on the matter of how "paper straws don't work" where he pushes for the production of plastic which strongly opposes our views on the matter.

Our dataset: Our dataset is the debate between the two opposing perspectives on the matter - Donald Trump and David Attenbourough's statements - and the graphs/statistics provided by the BBC about the rapid increase of plastic found in the ocean.

Website Design: 
In terms of the visual style of the website, we wanted it to be minimal, simple and easy to read. The blue palette was used to represent the ocean against a white background. The content was divided across five web pages to make it more manageable and easier to absorb in smaller, organised sections.
For extra creativity, fun and engagement, three of the web pages play a themed sound effect when clicked on. We believed that this would help enhance user experience and immersion.

Technical: 
The website is easy for users to navigate around, the fixed navigation bar at the top allows for simple userinterface. We alos have included an adaptive image gallery that fits any screen size and layout integration is kept and blocks for any overlapping or breaking of the page.

Challenges: 
There was a large volume of research from many sources.  This required careful selection of credible data and identification of key themes.  It was very challenging to summarise the research into clear, accessible content for a general audience. #
