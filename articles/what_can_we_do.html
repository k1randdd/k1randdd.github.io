<h1>What Can We Do?</h1>

<h2>Reduce plastic use</h2>

<div class="action_list">

<div>
Think about how many plastic straws you use and in general all the plastic items you use in your daily life. Can you even count them all? Being more aware of the way you use plastic is a great starting point to reduce plastic waste.
</div>
<div>
Where possible, avoid straws completely, even if they re made from paper, as this reduces the need for resources to produce and dispose of them.
</div>
<div>
If you need to use one, swap plastic straws for paper ones or ones made of reuseable materials.
</div>
<div>
Carry a set of mini-reusable set including a reusable straw, fork and spoon.
</div>
<div>
More broadly, reduce the use of disposable plastic cups, plates, cutlery and bottles. For example, bring your own reusable bottle to work and a reusable coffee cup for your morning take-away!)
</div>
<div>
Buy food and cleaning products in bulk to avoid useless plastic wrappings. Nowadays, there are plenty of options to choose from, and many supermarkets let you fill your own jars/bags.
</div>
<div>
Choose metal or glass food containers and storage options instead of plastic ones.
</div>
<div>
Try to avoid buying and using cosmetics that contain plastic microspheres or microbeads
</div>

</div>

<h2>Participate in (or organise) a cleanup</h2>

<div class="action_list">

<div>
If you live by a sea or river, you can volunteer to pick up litter in your local community, thus remove plastics from the waterways and preventing them from getting to the ocean in the first place. There are many organizations you can join, or simply do it on the weekend with your friends and family.
</div>

</div>

<h2>Support the right legislation</h2>

<div class="long_paragraphs">

<div>
Of course, it is essential to change our individual behaviours and habits, but unfortunately, this is not sufficient to prevent and stop ocean plastic pollution. It is also essential that you support legislation that aims at reducing the use and production of plastic, improve recycling facilities and better manage waste in general.
</div>

</div>

<h2>Support research and organisations</h2>

<div class="long_paragraphs">

<div>
One of the main weapons we can use to stop ocean pollution is research. By deepening our knowledge of the effects of the issue, we can start implementing better policies for all. There are many NGOs and non-profit that rely on donations to develop their projects and research for reducing and eliminating plastic from the ocean. Here are some examples:
