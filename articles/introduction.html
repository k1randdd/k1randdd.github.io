<h2>So... What Do The Scientists Say?</h2>

<div>
The UN, WWF, (add others) argue that plastic straws contributes to overall plastic pollution and is impacting the health of our ocean and ecosystems.   Items like plastic straws, pose a threat to marine life, the food chain, human health and the delicate balance of our planet's aquatic environments.

Plastic is one of the most enduring materials man has created and as humans we dispose of it without thinking. As a result, marine life get entangled in our plastic straws.  Plus, we know that it can take  hundreds of years for plastic to degrade, and research is showing that it is possible that it does not even fully degrade, but becomes what we call microplastic.  Microplastics are tiny particles of plastic that can be eaten by marine animals and end up in their bodies and tissues, entering the food chain and leading to disastrous consequences for the health of our planet and all its inhabitants.
