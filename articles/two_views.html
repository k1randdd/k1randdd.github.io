<h1>Impact of plastic straws on marine life</h1>

<h2>Two influential people with opposing views – who is right?</h2>

<div class="introduction">
  <p>
    This article explores the growing crisis of marine life cruelty caused 
    by human dependence on plastics—particularly single-use items like straws. While microplastics are infiltrating our oceans and harming wildlife
    the debate continues over how far society should go in banning or limiting plastic products. Some argue that alternatives like paper straws are ineffective or inconvenient, 
    while others point to the irreversible damage being done to marine ecosystems as plastics enter the food chain.

  <p>
    <strong>Pros of plastic straws and products:</strong> convenience, durability, low manufacturing cost, water resistance.  
    <br/>
    <strong>Cons:</strong> environmental persistence, harm to marine life, contribution to microplastic pollution, limited recyclability.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this artical, the everlasting effects of plastics on marine life will be analysed and put into perspective. Humans are the only cause for this occuring issue and we are the only ones who can put an end to it.
    Below we can see a contrast of two influential voices with sharply different views on plastic use—former U.S. President Donald Trump and renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough—to examine the balance between practicality and environmental responsibility.
